            EJ Group, formerly East Jordan Iron Works, is an American manufacturer of iron products, headquartered in East Jordan, Michigan. The company manufactures and distributes iron construction castings (Municipal castings), fabricated products, composite products, water distribution solutions, and other infrastructure access products for water, sewer, drainage, telecommunications, and utility networks worldwide.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>EJ was founded in East Jordan, Michigan in 1883. The company was established in November 1883 by William Malpass and his father-in-law, Richard W. Round, to service the logging industry in East Jordan and around Northern Michigan. In the early years of operation, EJ manufactured castings for necessities such as machine parts, ship parts, agricultural uses, and railroads. In 1886, when William's brother James joined the business, the company was renamed to East Jordan Iron Works. In 1905, the foundry was destroyed by a fire but was then rebuilt using bricks made in its hometown of East Jordan.<br/><br/>In the 1920s, lumbering operations began to decrease after the advent of the Great Depression. By World War II, lumbering had moved out of the area, and EJ then shifted their large-scale production to street castings, water works valves, and fire hydrants as well as war materials needed for the war effort such as tank parts.<br/><br/>The Ardmore foundry was built in 2000 and opened in 2001.
