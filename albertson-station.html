            Albertson is a station on the Long Island Rail Road's Oyster Bay Branch. The station is on the north side of I.U. Willets Road at Albertson Avenue on the Albertson–Roslyn Heights border, in Nassau County, New York. The parking lot is located on the south side of I.U. Willets Road. The station is located adjacent to the Clark Botanic Garden.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The station was originally opened with name Albertson's and originally opened as a milk station in March 1874 and opened as a flag stop in June 1875 by the Glen Cove Branch Rail Road. The station was renamed as Albertson in 1903. The station had a depot building built in 1911, and it lasted until 1954, when it was razed.<br/><br/>On November 30, 1943, a 53-year-old woman driving a Ford sedan was killed when a train collided with her vehicle as she was driving across the I.U. Willets Road grade crossing, adjacent to the Albertson station. At the time of the incident, the grade crossing was not equipped with gates.<br/><br/>In 1960, the LIRR planned to close the station as well as East Williston station and replace them both with a single station between the two sites.
