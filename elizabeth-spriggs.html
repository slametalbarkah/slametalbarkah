            Elizabeth Jean Spriggs (18 September 1929 – 2 July 2008) was an English actress.<br/><br/>Spriggs' roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company included Nurse in Romeo and Juliet, Gertrude in Hamlet, and Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing. In 1978, she won the Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actress for Arnold Wesker's Love Letters on Blue Paper. She received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress for the 1995 film Sense and Sensibility. Her other films included Richard's Things (1980), Impromptu (1991), Paradise Road (1997), and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and career ==<br/><br/>Born in Buxton, Derbyshire, in 1929, Spriggs had an unhappy childhood, later stating that she "grew up entirely without affection". Possessing a mezzo-soprano voice, she studied opera at the Royal College of Music, and taught speech and drama in Coventry. Her first marriage at 21 was a disaster and, in what she called "the most painful decision of my life", she left her husband and young daughter to pursue her acting dream. "The desire to act was like a weight within me", she later said, "and I knew if I didn't do anything about it, it would destroy me". She wrote to a repertory company in Stockport, Cheshire, asking for a job and was taken on.
