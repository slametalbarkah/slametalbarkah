            Barrigada (Chamorro: Barigåda) is a village in the United States territory of Guam. A largely residential municipality, its main village is located south of the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport near the intersections of Routes 8, 10, and 16.  The community east of the airport known as Barrigada Heights is considered an affluent neighborhood on the island, where homes have excellent views overlooking much of Guam including the island's airport and hotels along Tumon Bay. Another significant location is Mount Barrigada, nearly 200 meters above sea level. Its location in the center of the island means it houses most of the island's radio masts and towers; the position and height make it easier for radio signals to reach the entire island.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>From 2 to 4 August 1944, the United States Marine Corps engaged troops from the Empire of Japan at present-day Barrigada Heights during the battle of Guam, a year before the end of the Second World War. When the Japanese line collapsed, American forces pursued them to the north, winning the battle. In recent years, the three main highways in Barrigada have been renamed in honor of the U.S. Military. Route 8 is designated Purple Heart Memorial Highway; Route 10 is designated Vietnam Veterans Highway; and Route 16 is designated Army Drive.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Tiyan (Former NAS Agana) ==<br/><br/>North of Routes 8 and 16 is the former Naval Air Station Agana, most of which lies within the boundary of Barrigada.
