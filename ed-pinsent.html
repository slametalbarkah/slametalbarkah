            Edward Pinsent (born 1960) is a British cartoonist, artist, and writer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Ed Pinsent is the son of the classical scholar John Pinsent and was brought up in the city of Liverpool.<br/><br/>Pinsent has written and drawn his own small press comics since 1982, including characters such as Primitif, Henrietta and Windy Wilberforce. Around 1987 he took over Fast Fiction, the market stall, magazine, mail order distributor and news sheet that played a key role in the history of British small press comics. It existed in its various forms from 1981 through to 1990 under the stewardship of Paul Gravett, Phil Elliott and Ed Pinsent. The name was taken from a Classics Illustrated knock-off spotted in the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide. Pinsent, who had been aware of the cassette culture music trading scene, subsequently took over from Elliott and continued to run things until 1990. Fast Fiction #30 in 1991 was the last issue of the flagship magazine which Pinsent edited. Following the closure of Fast Fiction the mailing list was passed on to Luke Walsh and Mike Kidson, who used it to launch the small press comics review zine Zum!.<br/><br/>Pinsent's comic strip work has also appeared in the pages of pssst!, Escape Magazine, Knockabout Comics, and Fox Comics in Australia.
