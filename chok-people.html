<h1>Chok people</h1>
            
            The Chok were a society that lived on the Elgeyo Escarpment in Kenya.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/>It is noted that the old men living in Pokot during the early 20th century were unanimous in declaring that;<br/><br/><br/><br/>there always were two original Suk tribes living on the Elgeyo escarpment. The names of these two tribes were Chok or Chuk which is the name for a short sword like implement, and Sekker which means 'cowrie shells' <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Territory ==<br/><br/>Their territory was "on the Elgeyo Escarpment" and while they lived on the Elgeyo escarpment the Kerio Valley was occupied by the Sambur. "..If ever the Suk descended from their fastness, they were raided and harried by this tribe".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Way of life ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Residence ===<br/><br/>Von Hönnel writing following his journey to Lake Turkana, remarked on the residences of the Suk, using much the same terms that other writers would make use of;<br/><br/><br/><br/>...The sedentary Suk are restricted to the eastern slopes of the mountain, and dwell in pretty little round huts made of hewn tree trunks with conical thatch of dhurra stalks. Most of their settlements are rather hamlets than villages...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Agriculture ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Beech (1911) noted that the Chok were a "purely agricultural people, cultivating millet and eleusine grain grown in the cold air of the summit and possibly a little tobacco." The "millet [was] grown on the fertile and well watered flats at the base of the Elgeyo escarpment, and [was] watered by means of irrigation, while eleusine grain (was) grown high upon the hill sides and was dependent on rain". The irrigation system as Beech noted, "is most ingenious, and its original construction must have required a vast amount of toil and patience". MacDonald who came across an agricultural 'Suk' village during the last decade of the nineteenth century described a similar subsistence pattern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>...The section of the Suk people we had now met...build their huts and small hamlets, high up on the hillsides...many beautiful streams issue from the hills and find their way out onto the plains below...The Suk by means of skillful irrigation channels, utilize these streams for watering their fields at the base of the hills, where at times large areas of grain are seen under cultivation.
