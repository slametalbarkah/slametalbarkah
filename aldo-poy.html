            Aldo Pedro Poy (Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina, 14 September 1945) is a retired football player and current politician. He spent his entire career at Rosario Central, playing as forward. Poy debuted on 3 October 1965 against Huracán, playing his last match as professional on 30 December 1974 against Newell's Old Boys.<br/><br/>Poy is considered one of the most representative players of Rosario Central, having also played for the Argentina national football team in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. His son Mauro is also a footballer. Poy is currently a city councillor in his home town, representing the Partido Demócrata Progresista.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/>During his beginning as a footballer, Poy was strongly questioned by Central's supporters so he was about to leave the club in 1969 when Club Atlético Los Andes (that played in Primera División by then) was interested in hiring him. It is said that Poy hid in the islands near to Paraná river to avoid being found and transferred to Los Andes. The legend says that Poy was hidden during a week until he returned to Rosario where he rejected the offer to play at Los Andes.<br/><br/>In 1971 Poy won the Primera División championship with Rosario Central.
