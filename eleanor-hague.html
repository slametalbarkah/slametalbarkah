            Eleanor Hague (October 7, 1875 – December 25, 1954) was an American folklorist and musicologist, who specialized in the traditional music of Latin America.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hague was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of geologist and mining engineer James Duncan Hague and Mary Ward Foote Hague. Through the Foote family, she was related to the Beechers and to many other prominent New England families. Writer Kate Foote Coe was her aunt; her uncle Arthur De Wint Foote was a noted engineer, and husband of book illustrator Mary Hallock Foote. Another aunt married politician Joseph Roswell Hawley; his daughter, her first cousin Margaret Foote Hawley, was an artist. <br/><br/>Hague studied music in New York and Massachusetts, and abroad in France and Italy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>As a young woman in New York, Hague was a member of the New York Oratorio Society, and was a church choir director. <br/><br/>Hague collected, preserved, and published folk songs from Latin America and Spanish California. She was credited as arranger on a 1925 Victor recording of "Carmela" by Dusolina Giannini. She is best known for discovering the bound manuscript notebooks of Joseph María García, an eighteenth-century Mexican dance master, who made shorthand notations about how to perform specific dance steps.
