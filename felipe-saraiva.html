<h1>Felipe Saraiva</h1>
            
            Felipe Saraiva de Souza Silva (born 9 March 1998), known as Felipe Saraiva, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Ituano on loan from Maringá. Mainly a forward, he can also play as an attacking midfielder.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Club career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Ponte Preta ===<br/><br/>Saraiva was born in Santa Isabel, São Paulo, and joined Ponte Preta's youth setup in 2014. On 12 February 2016, after impressing with their under-17 side, he was loaned to São Paulo for the season. Initially assigned to their under-20 squad, he also featured in the year's Copa Paulista.<br/><br/>Upon returning to Ponte in January 2017, Saraiva was assigned to the main squad and made his first team – and Série A – debut on 25 June 2017, coming on as a second-half substitute for Elton in a 1–2 home loss against Palmeiras. He scored his first senior goal on 13 September, netting his team's only in a 1–3 away loss against Sport Recife, for the year's Copa Sudamericana.<br/><br/>Saraiva lost his starting spot after being regularly used in the 2017 Série A (where his club suffered relegation) and in the 2018 Campeonato Paulista. On 29 January 2019, he was loaned to Botafogo-SP for the 2019 campaign.<br/><br/>Back at Ponte for the 2020 season, Saraiva featured sparingly before leaving the club in June 2020, after failing to agree to new terms.
