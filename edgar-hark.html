            Edgar Hark (8 October 1908 - 23 October 1986) was an Estonian prelate who was the Archbishop of Tallinn and Primate of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church between 1978 and 1986.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Hark was born on 8 October 1908 in Tartu in the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire, the son of Saul and Alvine Hark. Soon thereafter, the family moved to Saint Petersburg where they lived for a time. In Saint Petersburg he started his schooling at the Elementary School of the Estonian Educational Society. In 1920, the family moved back to Estonia. He received his secondary education at the Hugo Treffner Gymnasium in Tartu and graduated in 1928. He then spent some time in the military. In 1929, he commenced his theology studies at the University of Tartu. Due to the economic strains that his family experienced, Hark had to work as a student between 1930 and 1935 to support himself and his family, since his father was unemployed. In the spring of 1935 he graduated from university.
