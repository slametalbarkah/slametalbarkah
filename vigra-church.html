            Vigra Church (Norwegian: Vigra kyrkje) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Haram Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It is located on the island of Vigra, about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) southwest of the village of Roald. It is the church for the Vigra parish which is part of the Nordre Sunnmøre prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Møre. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1894 using plans drawn up by the architect Gabriel Smith. The church seats about 500 people.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1432, but the church was not new at that time. The original Vigra Church was a wooden stave church that was located in the village of Roald, about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) northeast of the present day site of the church. The church was possibly built in the 13th century. Very little is known about this old medieval stave church except that it existed until 1756 when it was struck by lightning and burned down. A new timber-framed, cruciform church was constructed on the same site in 1756.
