            Allroy's Revenge is the second studio album by the American punk rock band All, released in 1989 through Cruz Records. It was the band's first release with singer Scott Reynolds, replacing Dave Smalley who had left in late 1988. The album includes two songs written by Tony Lombardo, the original bassist for All's precursor band the Descendents. It also includes a cover version of "Hot Rod Lincoln", a 1955 song by Charlie Ryan that was a hit for Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen in 1971. "She's My Ex" was released as the album's single.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>All's first singer, Dave Smalley, left the band in late 1988, burned out by their constant touring schedule. To replace him the band recruited Scott Reynolds, who had moved to Los Angeles from Fredonia, New York several years prior: "I got out of college and got in the car and drove out here because I decided that I wanted to be a singer", he said in 1989. "So I'm out here and I live on a shelf in an office." He joined original Descendents bassist Tony Lombardo's post-Descendents bands Boxer Rebellion, Nuclear Bob, and Three Car Pileup, briefly touring with the Descendents when Boxer Rebellion performed as an opening act for them. The Descendents relaunched themselves as All in 1987 following Milo Aukerman's departure from the band. By the time they were looking for a new singer to replace Smalley, Reynolds was practicing with Three Car Pileup next door to All's headquarters in Lomita, California.
