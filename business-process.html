            A business process, business method, or business function is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks performed by people or equipment in which a specific sequence produces a service or product (that serves a particular business goal) for a particular customer or customers. Business processes occur at all organizational levels and may or may not be visible to the customers. A business process may often be visualized (modeled) as a flowchart of a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points or as a process matrix of a sequence of activities with relevance rules based on data in the process. The benefits of using business processes include improved customer satisfaction and improved agility for reacting to rapid market change. Process-oriented organizations break down the barriers of structural departments and try to avoid functional silos.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/>A business process begins with a mission objective (an external event) and ends with achievement of the business objective of providing a result that provides customer value. Additionally, a process may be divided into subprocesses (process decomposition), the particular inner functions of the process. Business processes may also have a process owner, a responsible party for ensuring the process runs smoothly from start to finish.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, business processes can be organized into three types, according to von Rosing et al.:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Operational processes, which constitute the core business and create the primary value stream, e.g., taking orders from customers, opening an account, and manufacturing a component<br/><br/>Management processes, the processes that oversee operational processes, including corporate governance, budgetary oversight, and employee oversight<br/><br/>Supporting processes, which support the core operational processes, e.g., accounting, recruitment, call center, technical support, and safety training<br/><br/>There are other definitions of the classification of processes proposed by <br/><br/><br/><br/>Strategic processes, which are managerial, directive or steering processes. Management has an important role in each of these.
