            Plasma coblation is a tonsillectomy procedure  which involves the removal of tissue through radio frequency wavelengths. Coblation (derived from “Controlled ablation” meaning the removal of tissue in a controlled manner) techniques have been present since the 1950s and have been developed so that errors can be removed to achieve a surgical techniques that is free from both defects and negative affects.<br/><br/>This technique has revolutionized modern medicine in-order to achieve efficient surgical procedures with little complications as possible. It is widely used in medical research areas today such as biochemical engineering and microbiology which have allowed for the development and advancement of many surgical devices.<br/><br/>This process consists of five stages, which is significantly less than the traditional tonsillectomy method therefore allowing the technique of Plasma Coblation to the overall time required for the typical procedure, however there are also negatives associated with the device. which indicate that there is no clear advantage or difference in comparison to traditional surgical techniques today.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Electric surgical equipment was developed in the 1950. They provided a revolutionized way of using high frequency wavelengths in order to disintegrate unwanted cell matter. First it began with the use of radio frequency passing through the devices medium. Its development throughout the years began which was the experimentation with higher and more efficient plasma frequency made up of charged ions to target unwanted matter in the arteries.
