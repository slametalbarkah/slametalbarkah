            Aquiles Priester (born 25 June 1971) is a Brazilian drummer. He is currently the drummer of Brazilian power metal band Hangar, and progressive metal bands Midas Fate and Noturnall. As a tour drummer, Priester has played with Paul Di'Anno, Vinnie Moore, Tony MacAlpine, W.A.S.P. and DragonForce. From 2001 to 2008, he was the drummer of Angra, recording three albums which were certified gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Priester was born in Outjo, South West Africa (now Namibia) to Brazilian parents. His first exposure to the instrument was at age four while watching a jazz ensemble perform on television.<br/><br/>Priester moved to Brazil in 1977, and played football in teams like Foz do Iguaçu in Paraná, ABC, and Guairacá Flamenguinho until 1985. In 1985 he attended the Rock in Rio festival where he decided to become a drummer. Although he began playing on cans, he would eventually assemble a set consisting of a snare, tom (which he borrowed from his school), bass drum, hihat, and a cymbal, which he hung from his roof. His biggest influences are Nicko McBrain of Iron Maiden and Deen Castronovo of Journey.
