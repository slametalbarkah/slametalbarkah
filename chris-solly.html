            Christopher James Solly (born 20 January 1991) is an English former professional footballer who played as a right back.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Charlton Athletic ===<br/><br/>Solly was born in Rochester, Kent. On 3 May 2009, he made his debut for Charlton Athletic, coming on as a first-half substitute for the injured Darren Ward in a 4–2 victory over Norwich City. Solly made his full debut for the 1st team in the Football League Trophy against Barnet on 6 October 2009. He scored his first goal for the club after coming on as a substitute in the 3–1 win over Leyton Orient on 13 August 2010. Due to the uncertainty over the future of Carl Jenkinson, Solly established himself as first choice right back towards the end of the 2010–11 season.<br/><br/>Despite the arrival of Andy Hughes, he continued to keep his place in the side the following season. Following an impressive 2011–12 season, Solly was voted Charlton's Player of the Year by supporters and selected as Young Player of the Year by the club's management team. He became the first Charlton player to win both awards in the same season since defender Richard Rufus in 1995.<br/><br/>Solly continued his impressive form into the 2012–13 season as Charlton finished 9th in their first season back in the Championship.
