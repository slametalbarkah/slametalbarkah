            Giorgio Baglivi (Latin: Georgius Baglivus; Croatian: Gjuro Baglivi; September 8, 1668 – June 15, 1707), born Giorgio Armeno and sometimes anglicized as George Baglivi, was a Croatian-Italian physician and scientist. He made important contributions to clinical education, based on his own medical practice. His De Fibra Motrice advanced the "solidist" theory that the solid parts of organs are more crucial to their good functioning than their fluids, against the traditional belief in four humors. Baglivi, however, advocated against doctors relying on any general theory rather than careful observation. He was "a distinguished physiological researcher fascinated by the nerves, his microscopic studies enabled him to distinguish between smooth and striated muscles and distinct kinds of fibres."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Giorgio was born to Blasius Armeno and Anna de Lupis on September 8, 1668, in Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia). His mother was Croatian, while his father was possibly of Armenian descent His parents were respectable but poor merchants who both died in 1670, after the birth of Giorgio's younger brother Jacob (Latin: Jacobus). The brothers were originally raised by their uncle and educated at Ragusa's Jesuit college.<br/><br/>At 15, the brothers moved to Lecce in Apulia, where they took the name of his adoptive father, a wealthy physician named Pietro Angelo Baglivi. Giorgio studied first at the universities of Salerno, then successively at Padua and Bologna and possibly also Naples. He attended Lorenzo Bellini's lectures in Pisa and worked in hospitals in Padua and Venice, Florence, and Bologna and travelled to the Dutch Republic and England from 1688 to 1692.
