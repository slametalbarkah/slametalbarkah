<h1>John Osmers</h1>
            
            John Robert Osmers  (23 February 1935 – 16 June 2021) was a New Zealand anti-apartheid activist. He was Anglican Bishop of Eastern Zambia from 1995 to 2002.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Osmers was born in Ashburton on 23 February 1935, the son of the Reverend Eric A. Osmers, and was raised in Anglican vicarages in New Zealand. After completing his schooling at Christchurch Boys' High School, Osmers obtained a BA, and an MA(Hons) in English language and literature, at Canterbury University College, Christchurch.<br/><br/>Osmers read about apartheid in South Africa in Trevor Huddleston's book Nought for our Comfort. In 1958, he travelled to South Africa by ship and toured the country by motorbike for six weeks. This visit determined his wish to work eventually in Southern Africa. For one year, he studied anthropology at the London School of Economics (LSE), as well the Sesotho language at School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>With the encouragement of Father Huddleston, Osmers decided to study to become an Anglican priest, and studied for two years at Mirfield Theological College, Yorkshire, England, run by monks of the Community of the Resurrection, a community with a long history of involvement in southern Africa. He was ordained in 1961, and worked as a priest for three years in the Yorkshire working-class parish of Rawmarsh near Rotherham.
