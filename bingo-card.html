            Bingo cards are playing cards designed to facilitate the game of Bingo in its various forms around the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In the early 1500s the people of Italy began to play a game called "Lo Gioco del Lotto d'Italia," which literally means "The game of lotto of Italy." The game operated very much like a modern lottery as players placed bets on the chances of certain numbers being drawn. By the 1700s, a version of Lo Gioco del Lotto d'Italia was played in France, where paper cards were first used to keep track of numbers drawn by a caller.<br/><br/>Before the advent of printing machines, numbers on bingo cards were either painted by hand or stamped using rubber stamps onto thick cardboard. Cards were reusable, meaning players used tokens to mark called numbers. The number of unique cards was limited as randomization had to occur by hand. Before the advent of online Bingo, cards were printed on card stock and, increasingly, disposable paper. While cardboard and paper cards are still in use, Bingo halls are turning more to "flimsies" (also called "throwaways") — a card inexpensively printed on very thin paper to overcome increasing cost — and electronic Bingo cards to overcome the difficulty with randomization.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Types of cards ==<br/><br/>There are two types of Bingo cards.  One is a 5x5 grid meant for 75-ball Bingo, which is largely played in the U.S. The other uses a 9x3 grid for U.K. style "Housie" or 90-ball Bingo.
