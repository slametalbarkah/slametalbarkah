            Douglas Robert Favell (born April 5, 1945) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender and former box lacrosse player. Favell played in the National Hockey League for the Philadelphia Flyers, Toronto Maple Leafs and Colorado Rockies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Favell, along with future Flyers' teammate Bernie Parent, played his junior hockey for the Niagara Falls Flyers in the OHA. After the club won the Memorial Cup in 1965, both goalies began their professional careers in the Boston Bruins organization, who held their rights.  Over the next two seasons, Favell played in the Bruins' farm system.<br/><br/>Favell, like Chicago Black Hawks goaltender Tony Esposito, was one of the few goaltenders then to employ the now-popular butterfly style, often going down to the ice to block shots in an era where the stand-up style of play dominated.<br/><br/>With the arrival of the six new expansion clubs for the 1967–68 NHL season, Favell and Parent were selected by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft. The goalies split the work that first season and led the Flyers to a first-place finish in the NHL's Western Division.  Favell had a stellar 2.27 GAA with four shutouts.  Both goalies toiled for the Flyers until Parent was dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs in February 1971. <br/><br/>Without Parent, Favell became the Flyers' workhorse goalie.
