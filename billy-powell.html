            William Norris Powell (June 3, 1952 – January 28, 2009) was an American musician and the keyboardist of southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd from 1972 until his death in 2009.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life ===<br/><br/>Powell was born in Corpus Christi, Texas. He grew up in a military family and spent several of his childhood years in Italy, where his father was stationed with the U.S. Navy. After his father died of cancer in 1960, the Powells returned to the United States to settle in Jacksonville, Florida. In elementary school, Powell met Leon Wilkeson, who became a lifelong friend and the bassist for Lynyrd Skynyrd. Powell took an interest in piano and he began taking piano lessons from a local teacher named Madalyn Brown, who claimed that Billy did not need a teacher as he was a natural and picked things up well on his own. When it was time for high school, his mother enrolled Billy and his brother Ricky at Sanford Naval Academy in Sanford, Florida. Powell returned to Jacksonville, where he enrolled at Bishop Kenny High School. After graduation in 1970, he enrolled at and briefly attended a community college, majoring in music theory.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Lynyrd Skynyrd ===<br/><br/>Around 1970, Powell found work as a roadie for Lynyrd Skynyrd and remained a member of the crew for two years, during which the band secured a support role for the band Mountain.
