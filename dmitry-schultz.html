            Dmitry Ivanovich Shultz (1893 (?), Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Empire – April 2, 1930, Moscow, USSR) was a religious figure, creator, and leader of the sect United Temple, which operated in the 1920s. Dmitry Shultz developed both the theoretical basis of the sect's activities and thoroughly elaborated its rituals.<br/><br/>Dmitry Shultz was born into an intelligent family and showed a talent for writing and theater as a child. He graduated from the Nizhny Novgorod Count Arakcheev Cadet Corps and studied at the Moscow Commercial Institute, where he attended lectures by the theologian Sergei Bulgakov. In the 1920s, he created a community of mystically inclined young people who were initially drawn to the ideas of spiritualism and later to the creation of a new syncretic religion. Over time, elements of sadism, masochism, and sexual perversion began to emerge within this community, which eventually transformed into a totalitarian religious sect with openly anti-Soviet views.<br/><br/>In March 1930, following a trial widely covered by the central press, Dmitry Shultz was sentenced to capital punishment under Article 58-10 of the RSFSR Criminal Code ("for propaganda calling for the undermining or weakening of Soviet power, using religious prejudices") and was executed by firing squad. Ilya Braude, a lawyer and participant in open political trials, was involved in the trial. The forensic psychiatric examination was conducted by prominent scientists and doctors of medicine: Pyotr Gannushkin, Wolf Vnukov, and Yevgeny Krasnushkin. Doctor of Historical Sciences Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich also participated as an expert on religious studies.
