            David Dziurzynski (born October 6, 1989) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who is currently playing with the Kansas City Mavericks in the ECHL. He previously played with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/>Dziurzynski, who played junior in the British Columbia Hockey League with the Alberni Valley Bulldogs, was signed by the Ottawa Senators on April 6, 2010, as an undrafted free agent to a three-year contract.<br/><br/>At training camp in 2010, Dziurzynski made the roster of the Senators' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate Binghamton Senators. He was a member of the 2011 AHL Calder Cup championship squad. Dziurzynski returned to Binghamton for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons. Dziurzynski made his NHL debut, playing for Ottawa in Toronto against the Toronto Maple Leafs on February 16, 2013. Three days later he scored his first NHL goal against Rick DiPietro of the New York Islanders. And on February 25 scored his second against Carey Price of the Montreal Canadiens. On March 6, 2013, he was knocked out by a punch in a fight against the Toronto Maple Leafs' Frazer McLaren resulting in a concussion that kept him from playing for over 10 days. Dziurzynski was reassigned to Binghamton later that month.
