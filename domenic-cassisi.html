            Domenic Cassisi (born 22 September 1982) is a former premiership winning Australian rules footballer with the Port Adelaide Football Club, and was the club's 62nd captain from 2009 to 2012. He was recruited in the 2000 AFL Draft with pick 50, and is a member of Port Adelaide's 2004 premiership side.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== AFL career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early career (2002–2003) ===<br/><br/>Between 2002 and 2003 Cassisi only played 18 games and had restricted ground time despite his excellent game on debut he needed training before the 2004 season arrived.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Career high (2004–2005) ===<br/><br/>In 2004 his career took a step forward, playing all 25 games and enjoying good form whilst also playing a major role in the club's 2004 premiership win. In 2005 he repeated his efforts, having another excellent year by averaging 16 disposals a game and gathering 57 more possessions than the year before. He also polled third in the club's best and fairest award.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Injury (2006) ===<br/><br/>In 2006 Cassisi missed seven games due to injury, but found just enough form in his limited game time to uphold his reputation as one of the most important players at the club. However, at season's end he lost his spot as vice captain.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Leadership (2007–2008) ===<br/><br/>After another excellent season in 2007, Cassisi accepted a three-year deal with the club, ensuring that he would stay with Port until 2010. He also was reinstated as Vice Captain.
