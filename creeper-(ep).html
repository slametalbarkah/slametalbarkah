            Creeper is the debut extended play (EP) by English rock band Creeper. Recorded in April 2014 at the Ranch Production House in Southampton with producer Neil Kennedy, it was originally released independently as a digital download on 19 June 2014. The EP was later issued on limited edition 12" vinyl by Palm Reader Records in December 2014, followed by another limited edition reissue in November 2020 by Roadrunner Records. "Gloom" and "VCR" were released as music videos.<br/><br/>Written primarily by the band's lead vocalist Will Gould and lead guitarist Ian Miles (with two tracks co-written by rhythm guitarist Sina Nemati), Creeper received positive reviews from music critics. Several commentators praised the release as a strong example of modern punk rock and a promising debut from the band, as well as comparing its sound to that of Alkaline Trio and AFI. Creeper was officially launched at a local show in August 2014, and promoted at more UK shows later in the year.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Creeper recorded their debut EP at The Ranch Production House in their hometown of Southampton with producer and engineer Neil Kennedy.
