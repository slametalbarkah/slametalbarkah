            Dod's Peerage (originally titled, The Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, Great Britain and Ireland, Including All the Titled Classes) was a long-running annual reference work, published annually, that listed members of the British aristocracy and titled classes. First published in 1841 by Charles Roger Phipps Dod, the series was an information source for peerage, baronetage, knightage, and later other dignitaries such as bishops, members of the Privy Council, and Companions of various orders.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Charles R. Dod (1793–1855), a parliamentary reporter and compiler, began the publication as a more frequently updated alternative to existing works like Debrett's Peerage and Burke's Peerage. After his death, the work was continued by his son, Robert Phipps Dod (c. 1822–1865), and various successors. The title and format evolved over the decades, but the purpose remained to provide reliable, up-to-date biographical information on Britain's titled classes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Editions and Publishers ==<br/><br/>The series was initially printed by Gilbert and Rivington and published by Whittaker &amp; Co. Later publishers included George Bell &amp; Sons; Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Company; and eventually Dod's Peerage, Limited, based at 12 Mitre Court Chambers, Temple, London. Over time, it was also distributed by Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co., Ltd.<br/><br/>Dod's Peerage was published annually from 1841 into the 20th century, with extant copies recorded as late as the 1960s.
