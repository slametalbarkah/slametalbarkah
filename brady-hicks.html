            Brady Hicks is a Philadelphia area journalist, radio personality, blogger, columnist, wrestling reporter, professional wrestling manager, play-by-play commentator, color analyst, and Pro Wrestling Illustrated contributing writer.<br/><br/>Over the years, Hicks has penned thousands of columns, features, and news stories, and starred in weekly radio programs and podcasts such as his own IN THE ROOM program, formerly of WEXP Philly, VOC Nation, formerly of WNJC, the DimpleDate Dating and Relationship Advice show, Jay V Mail, and About 12 Minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early years ==<br/><br/>Hicks was raised in suburban Philadelphia and attended La Salle University, where he gained recognition for his syndicated online wrestling columns, and time spent as head booker for his own subscriber-based e-mail wrestling league. As Hicks has stated on his show, this group had more than 500 subscribers at one time. Brady was also an avid reader of PWI "Apter Mags" growing up, and has credited Bill Apter himself was his biggest inspiration in his podcasts, as he often claimed during broadcasts of IN THE ROOM.<br/><br/>Hicks would go on to write and edit for several publishers and area newspapers, including weekly newspapers under the Journal Register Company banner, and Metblogs-sponsored sites. During this time, Brady - serving in his capacity as a blogger - attempted to use only Six Degrees of Separation to acquire an interview with then-WTXF-TV Fox 29 traffic reporter Dorothy Krysiuk, now of WCVB-TV ABC 5 in Boston, a challenge somewhat modeled after film My Date With Drew. After catching the attention of Philadelphia Weekly, Hicks would succeed in his goal.<br/><br/>In 2005, while on assignment with the Northeast News Gleaner in Philadelphia, Hicks met and interviewed former WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels for a cover story for the now-defunct newspaper. It was this interview (Michaels was the recipient of a Christian service award from Holy Family University) that inspired Hicks to become more active in wrestling journalism.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Wrestling journalism ==<br/><br/>Hicks is a contributing writer for Pro Wrestling Illustrated, and is a former staff member of The Wrestling Press and featured columnist for prowrestling.com and other websites.
