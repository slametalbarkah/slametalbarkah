            Alfonsa Clerici (14 February 1860 - 14 January 1930) was an Italian religious sister of the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood, a congregation that was founded by Maria Matilde Bucchi. <br/><br/>Clerici was beatified on 23 October 2010 in Vercelli; Archbishop Angelo Amato presided on the behalf of Pope Benedict XVI, who had approved the beatification the previous July. Alfonsa Clerici is commemorated on January 14.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Alfonsa Clerici was born on 14 February 1860 near Milan, the eldest of ten children to Angelo and Maria Romano Clerici, four of whom died in infancy. Clerici was baptized on 15 February in the church of San Vittore Martire and received her entrance into the faith from Father Francesco Spreafico.<br/><br/>Two of her brothers, Ildefonso and Prospero, joined the Barnabites, while her sister, Bonaventura entered the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood in Monza. <br/><br/>In 1875 Alfonsa enrolled at the College of the Precious Blood in Monza. She graduated in 1879 and went on to teach in the Lainate community school for four years. Clerici felt a strong desire to enter the religious life but decided to postpone plans since she still had to support her parents and her siblings. She pursued her call not long after and joined the sisters at Monza on 15 August 1883, the Feast of the Assumption.
