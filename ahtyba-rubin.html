            Ahtyba Rubin ( ah-TAH-bə; born July 25, 1986) is a former American football defensive tackle. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the sixth round of the 2008 NFL draft. He played college football at Iowa State.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early years ==<br/><br/>Born in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Rubin graduated from Escambia High School in Pensacola, Florida in 2004, the same high school as former Cleveland Browns teammate Trent Richardson, and NFL Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith. He then went on to attend Trinity Valley Community College in Athens, Texas. In his freshman year, he played defensive line, but was converted into an offense lineman for his sophomore year. Rubin made the adjustment with significant success and earned all-conference and honorable mention All-America honors in 2006.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== College career ==<br/><br/>Regarded as a three-star recruit out of junior college, Rubin was recruited by a number of schools, and eventually picked Iowa State over TCU. He was switched back to defensive line in his junior year, and started the last nine games of the 2006 season. He finished the year with 34 tackles, four tackles for loss, and a sack.<br/><br/>As a senior, Rubin played in all of the Cyclones' games, registering 42 tackles (with four for loss) and recording 1.5 sacks.
